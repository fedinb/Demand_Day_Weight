# Demand Day Weight

This code is meant to display the ratio of demand within a week. The point is that some products may have bigger demand on a specific weekday: for example, on Tuesdays. This information can be taken into account for replenishment planning. It will help specialists from supply planning or customer service departments to prepare for days with either low or high demand.

First part of code is taken from *Service Level and Coverage KPIs* script. Dataframe created with this script helps to build a bar chart for a specific product throughout a set number of weeks.
